# Thermal Verification and Testing



## Thermal Tests
 
###Thermal Cycle Tests

Thermal cycling subjects the test article to a number of cycles of hot and cold tem- 
perature plateaus in an ambient air or gaseous nitrogen environment. Convective 
heat transfer is enhanced such that the cycling can be relatively rapid. Cycling 
serves primarily as an environmental stress screen by revealing latent workman- 
ship or material defects. Performance verification is a secondary objective accom- 
plished through functional tests performed at hot and cold temperature plateaus.


###Thermal Vaccum Tests
Thermal vacuum tests subject the test article to a number of cycles of hot and cold 
temperatures in a vacuum environment. Because it is conducted without convec- 
tive heat transfer, this test is the most realistic ground simulation of the flight envi- 
ronment. Therefore its primary purpose is performance verification through 
functional testing. Temperature transition is slower than in the thermal cycling 
test, so stress screening is of secondary importance. 

#### Thermal Management Hardware
In general 25% of margin is used. This means that the heater should be oversized to 25%. Temperature margin of 11 degrees for passive methods. 
This value comes from the Spacecraft thermal control handbook reference. 

- Pasive 
- Active

3 types of TV temperature sensors: 

Thermocouples, uses two wires to produce a voltage relative to the temperature present in the junction between them. 
Temperature range is 200 to 1750 degrees
Accuracy (needs calibration) can be 0.5 to 5 degree 
Resistance Temperature Detector(RTD)
Very slow, the typical response time is 1 to 50 seconds. 

Thermistor. Mostly used in flight.



### Thermal Balance Test
Thermal balance tests, usually performed as part of subsystem or space vehicle 
thermal vacuum testing, have two purposes: verification of the thermal control subsystem and correlation of thermal analytic models. Dedicated test phases that 
simulate flight conditions are used to gather steady-state temperature data that are 
compared to model predictions. Test phases also simulate cold and hot conditions 
to verify all aspects of the thermal hardware and software, including heater opera- 
tion, radiator sizing, and critical heat transfer paths. 

### Burn-In Tests
Burn-in tests are typically part of unit thermal cycle tests in which additional test 
time is accrued to meet a set requirement. The unit is either cycled or held at an 
elevated hot temperature during the burn-in test, and the unit is operational, 
although functional tests are not performed.
