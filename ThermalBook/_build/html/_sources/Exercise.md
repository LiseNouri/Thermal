## Blackbody Earth

Calculate the radiant flux in an orbit at 200 km altitude that is emitted by the earth. Assume that Earth is a black body, Black body temperature T = 252 K and Earth mean radius R = 6371 km.

## Heat Balance in a Cube
Consider a 1 m cube, where the panel -Z  points to nadir, and the Y axis corresponds to the flight direction. The panels in ±Z and ±Y have the following optical properties: S/   = 0.15/0.75 (SSM) whereas the ±X panels have view to space and are perfectly insulated. 
The cube follows a polar earth orbit at 750 km altitude and the fluxes per panel can be seen in the Table.

$Q_{in}=Q_{solar}+Q_{albedo}$ 

What is the temperature of the Cube? You can assume that the body is isothermal. This means that there are no temperature gradients within the body, because the body is considered as a single point, or a single node.
