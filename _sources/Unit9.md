# Thermal Hardware

Typical elements of the thermal subsystem are:
- Surface coatings and finishes
- Multilayer insulations and heat shield / barriers
- Radiators
- Mounting materials (struts)
- Interface fillers, noth insulating and conducting
- Passive coolers
- Flexible conductive links
- Heat pipes, both passive (contact conductance) and actively pumped.
- Temperature sensors
- Heaters and thermostats
- Active coolers (e.g. Peltier elements or cryostats)
- Louvers
- Phase change materials
