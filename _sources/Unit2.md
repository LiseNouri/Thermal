# Spacecraft Thermal Environment

Spacecraft encounter a number of environments during their lifetime. In space the spacecraft is under the influence of: Deep space, Solar radiation, Albedo and Planetary infrared radiation

## Deep Space
Deep space is the cold darkness that surrounds the spacecraft. Due to cosmic background radiation, the temperature of deep space is 2.7K. For most engineering purposes this is set at 3K.[^ECSS] 
Taking into account the background radiation is significant for certain applications, such as cryogenic radiators and sensors. However for other application, it can also be neglected, e.g. the thermal balance of a rocket nozzle.

## Solar Radiation

Solar {term}`radiation` is the heat coming from the sun. The solar spectrum can be approximated by a black body curve with a temperature of 5778K [^ECSS], the peak of this spectrum is around 500nm wavelength. Most power of this radiation is in the familiar visible spectrum.

The heat produced by the sun is represented by the Solar Constant $S_\odot^N$, expressed in $W/m^2$. 
```{glossary}
The Solar Constant: 
	The value of the nominal total solar irradiance corresponds to the mean total electromagnetic energy from the Sun, integrated over all wavelengths, incident per unit area, and per unit time at a distance of 1 AU.
```
The current best estimate of the Solar constant is 1361 W/m2. Note that the Solar Constant is a mean value and should not be strictly considered a constant. The long term solar cycle varies approximately with 1.3 W/m2.  (ECSS-E-ST-10-04C-Rev1). The nominal value for the solar constant was determined officially in IAU 2015 resolution B3, during your career you are likely to encounter slightly different values from older documents. (Prsa et al, 2016, nom values).
A satellite around earth is exposed to different levels of solar radiation. When the earth is at Aphelion (summer solstice) it will be 1316 W/m2, in Perihelion (Winter solstice) 1407 W/m2.
