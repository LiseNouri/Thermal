# Spacecraft Thermal Environment

Spacecraft encounter a number of environments during their lifetime. In space the spacecraft is under the influence of: Deep space, Solar radiation, Albedo and Planetary infrared radiation

## Deep Space
Deep space is the cold darkness that surrounds the spacecraft. Due to cosmic background radiation, the temperature of deep space is 2.7K. For most engineering purposes this is set at 3K.[^ECSS] 
Taking into account the background radiation is significant for certain applications, such as cryogenic radiators and sensors. However for other application, it can also be neglected, e.g. the thermal balance of a rocket nozzle.

## Solar Radiation

Solar {term}`radiation` is the heat coming from the sun. The solar spectrum can be approximated by a black body curve with a temperature of 5778K [^ECSS], the peak of this spectrum is around 500nm wavelength. Most power of this radiation is in the familiar visible spectrum.
