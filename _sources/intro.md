# Learning Objectives

The student is able to generate a thermal design of a satellite using heat transfer analysis and thermal engineering techniques.

In more detail the student will be able to:
- Understand the spacecraft thermal environment
- Define the thermal subsystem and compare the different hardware options.
- Understand the design cycle of the thermal subsystem.
- Apply the concepts of heat transfer (radiation, conduction), heat balance and heat flows
- Generate and use analytical thermal analysis models
- Generate and use numerical thermal analysis models
